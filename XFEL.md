### Merging Serial XFEL Data with Careless

The data in `careless-examples/thermolysin_xfel` are serial crystallography data from thermolysin microcrystals. 
The parent experiment of these data is freely available at the [CXIDB](https://cxidb.org/id-81.html). 
Because the original data set is very large, this example deals with a single run containing 3,160 images.
The unmerged reflections, stored in `careless-examples/thermolysin_xfel/unmerged.mtz` were prepared with a custom `cctbx` [script](https://github.com/rs-station/careless/blob/master/scripts/stills2mtz). 


Enter the thermolysin directory and use [reciprocalspaceship](https://github.com/rs-station/reciprocalspaceship) to explore the contents of this mtz file. 

```bash
cd careless-examples/thermolysin_xfel
rs.mtzdump unmerged.mtz
```
The output will look like this:
```

This mtz has an extra column from the [stills2mtz](https://github.com/rs-station/careless/blob/master/scripts/stills2mtz) script, `ewald_offset`. 
This contains the magnitude of the Ewald offset vector between the observed reflection centroids and their centroids in reciprocal space. 
These are in a crystal-fixed cartesian [coordinate system](https://dials.github.io/documentation/conventions.html). 
Because we're dealing with still images here, each of the reflections have partial intensities which are dictated by how far away from the ideal Bragg contition they fall. 
The Ewald offset is a way of summarizing how disastified Bragg's law is for a particular reflection observation.

We will achieve the best merging performance with `Careless` if we include this column in the metadata supplied to the scaling model. 
Effectively, this enables the algorithm to learn a reciprocal lattice point model. 
For the sake of comparison, let's first merge the data without the Ewald offsets. 


```bash
mkdir merge #First make an output directory
careless mono \
  --anomalous \
  --mlp-layers=10 \
  --image-layers=2 \
  --dmin=1.8 \
  --iterations=30_000 \
  "dHKL,xobs,yobs" \
  unmerged.mtz \
  merge/thermolysin
```

In this example we use the `--image-layers` flag. 
This instructs `Careless` to add 2 neural network layers per image.
In single-crystal experiments, we can reasonably expect the scale to vary smoothly throughout a rotation series. 
However, this is not the case with serial data, because each image originates from a separate crystal with its own inherent scattering power.
We can overcome the intrinsic choppiness in the image scale function by learning separate neural network parameters for each image. 
XFEL beam intensities fluctuate much more than synchrotron sources so a per image layers may be warranted even for single-crystal XFEL experiments.
This is an open question for future work on variational merging.
Regardless, it is worth noting that the per image layers break the global scale parameterization in the default careless implementation. 
Luckily, it is easilly implemented and costs very little in terms of performance.
This example also uses the `--dmin` flag to set the maximum resolution to 1.8 Ã… which is the published resolution of this data set.
We use the `--anomalous` flag to indicate we would like to merge the Friedel mates separately.

After this is finished running, reapeat the procedure wiht a new base directory and supply the metadata keys for the Ewald offsets `"ewald_offset"`.

```bash
mkdir merge_eo #eo for Ewald offset
careless mono \
  --anomalous \
  --mlp-layers=10 \
  --image-layers=2 \
  --dmin=1.8 \
  --iterations=30_000 \
  "dHKL,xobs,yobs,ewald_offset" \
  unmerged.mtz \
  merge_eo/thermolysin
```

Now we can use the reference structure, [2tli](https://www.rcsb.org/structure/2TLI), to make a map with PHENIX.
There is a refinement script prepared for this. 

```bash
mkdir phenix
phenix.refine refine.eff
```

After PHENIX has finished, you can pull up the electron density map by typing
```
coot phenix/thermolysin_1.pdb phenix/thermolysin_1.mtz
```
This map should look fairly good for low redundancy XFEL data.

Now have a look at the anomalous difference map from the refined mtz.
You can look this in coot by selecting the ANOM and PHANOM colums.
